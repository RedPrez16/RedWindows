# RedWindows
NTLite Configuration File from AtlasOS with changes by me. Works with Windows 11 ONLY. 


#Usage 
Requires a NTLite Home or better license to use. Download the ISO file from Microsoft directly and then import it into NTLite. 
Then, import the .XML file and just go to "Apply" and then click "Process." Wait for it to do it's thing.
