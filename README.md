# RedWindows
NTLite Configuration File from AtlasOS with changes by me. Works with Windows 11 ONLY. 


#Usage 
Requires a NTLite Home or better license to use. Download the ISO file from Microsoft directly and then import it into NTLite. Then, import the .XML file. Go to the unattend tab. Change everything that says "ChangeMe!" Change it something personal as this is your username and password. Hint: Change the display name, the username, and the password. After all that, you can now proceed to "Apply" then click on process and let NTLite do its thing. It will ask you to disable Windows Defender. I highly recommend you do so as it'll be a lot slower doing everything if you don't. After it's done, make a USB VIA Rufus or something similar. Boot your computer into the boot picker and install RedWindows! 

Enjoy!
